# Trustpilot Sentiment Classification - MLOps Case

This repository contains a complete ML pipeline for a sentiment classification system trained on Amazon book reviews. The project was completed as part of a take-home interview case and includes data preprocessing, model training using Hugging Face Transformers, API deployment via FastAPI, experiment tracking with MLflow, testing, and Dockerization.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Data
Navigate to the notebooks/ folder and launch Jupyter:

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
Open `data_exploration_and_prepration.ipynb` and run it to have the preprocessed and clean data ready for training.

### 3. Train the Model

Run training with the desired number of epochs:

```bash
python app/train.py --epochs 3
python app/train.py --epochs 5
```

Artifacts:

- Model and tokenizer saved locally under `model_{epochs}epochs/` (will be created after training the model to save it locally)
- MLflow logs stored in `mlruns/` (will be auto-generated by MLflow; tracks experiment parameters, metrics, and artifacts for experiment reproducibility)
- Hugging Face training outputs saved in `outputs_{epochs}epochs/` (will be created automatically by Hugging Face's Trainer; contains checkpoints, optimizer states, and logs for each epoch)
- Saving structured output logs in `logs/` (will be auto-generated, configured in logging.basicConfig(). in api.py) 

### 4. Run the API Server using uvicorn

```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --reload
```

Then, send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict` with:

```json
{
  "text": "This book was fantastic!"
}
```
or using `httpie`

```bash
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict text="This book was fantastic!"
```

### 5. Measure API Latency

```bash
python app/test_inference_latency.py
```
---

## Testing
**Test Suite** for preprocessing logic and endpoint testing
Run unit tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_api.py
pytest tests/test_preprocessing.py
```
---

## Monitoring
**MLflow Tracking** for reproducible training and comparison across runs
Monitor the training and the models using `mlflow`:

```bash
mlflow ui
```
---

## Containerization
**Docker Support** for portable deployment
Use docker to containerize the project:
The API will download the model from Hugging Face on the first run (no manual upload needed).

```bash
docker build -t sentiment-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 sentiment-api
```
---

## CI Workflow
This repo includes a CI workflow in `.github/workflows/test.yml`, which automatically runs all unit tests on push.

---

## Model Info

- Base model: `distilbert-base-uncased`
- Fine-tuned on labeled Amazon book reviews
- 3 sentiment classes: positive, neutral, negative
- Hosted at: https://huggingface.co/MiladMt/sentiment-api-model

## Upoload your model to Hugginface
To upload your trained model to hf, use:

```bash
python upload_to_hf.py
```
