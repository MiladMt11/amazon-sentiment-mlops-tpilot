{"rating":4,"title":"Psychic\u2019s Visions Solve Serial Murders Occurring in Arizona Caves With Petroglyphs","text":"DESERT REMAINS: A GUS PARKER AND ALEX MILLS NOVEL has some bumpy writing (not-quite-consistent viewpoints), and a muddled, slightly disappointing ending, but overall it\u2019s a page-turner of a mystery\/thriller.  Parker (a psychic who\u2019s the real deal) and Mills (a veteran homicide detective nearing burnout) make an effective team, though Parker does all of the investigative heavy lifting.  His visions of murders past and future are what provide new leads and evidence, and what ultimately drives the plot.<br \/><br \/>In the novel, a young female hiker is discovered dead in a cave outside Phoenix, Arizona.  She was stabbed to death, and the cave wall displays a newly carved \u201cpetroglyph\u201d depicting her murder.  When Parker sees a TV report of the murder, he gets a disturbing vibe\u2014a woman he sees standing behind detective Mills is being watched by the killer.  Now.  In real time.<br \/><br \/>Parker knows that the woman is in danger, and may be the killer\u2019s next victim.  So he calls Mills, who has used Parker\u2019s services successfully in the past.  The call sets off another joint investigation, as the hiker murder turns out to be the first in a series of similar brutal murders (bodies found in caves near petroglyphs left by indigenous peoples, along with the killer\u2019s new rock carvings showing the murders).<br \/><br \/>A refreshing element of this novel, which is basically a police procedural, is that the investigation requires no lucky coincidences or dream revelations to move the plot forward.  Once the reader accepts that Parker is a genuine psychic whose visions are solidly grounded in fact, the story moves along rapidly without requiring further suspension of disbelief.<br \/><br \/>The plot also includes some debunking of fake psychics, some forensic profiling by a detective (Chase) who may have left the FBI under a cloud, and some parental angst over Mills\u2019 teenage son who is caught selling pot to an undercover FBI agent.  Parker has a few too many visions, in my opinion\u2014if he focuses, he can see far-distant people and their current surroundings (right down to the clothes they are wearing), and he can see future events (for example, that the fish a character will eat at dinner is bad).<br \/><br \/>Still, I enjoyed reading this novel.","images":[],"asin":"1633883531","parent_asin":"1633883531","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1507398213305,"helpful_vote":0,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":4,"title":"A Sensitive, Poetic Book about a Horrific Time","text":"Like several other Vine reviewers, I am finding it somewhat difficult to review &#34;Anna and the Swallow Man.&#34;  Set in Poland in 1939 and the few years following, the story follows 7-year-old Anna, whose father, a professor of linguistics, is taken captive by the Nazis and eventually killed.  We learn all of this in the first two pages of the book, but of course Anna knows nothing of this.  She knows only that her father left her in the care of someone who, when he figures out her father's likely fate, refuses to take her into his own home.  Left on her own, Anna is taken under the wing of a strange and mysterious person she calls the Swallow Man.  Together they travel throughout Poland for at least three years, trying to avoid both the Bears (the Russians) and the Wolves (the Germans).<br \/><br \/>In some ways this is a classic hero's journey story:  the hero (Anna) leaves everything she knows and holds dear to discover something of value that will enrich either herself or her community.  Along the way, the hero is accompanied by helpers (the Swallow Man, Reb Hirschel) and must endure tests and trials.  Often there are tempters, those who try to divert the hero from his or her journey (the Peddler, the pharmacist), but with the assistance of the helper(s) the hero prevails.  This book does not follow this motif exactly--for one thing, the main helper, the Swallow Man, is very complex and mysterious, and the ending is enigmatic.  However, much of the story reflects the Hero's Journey.<br \/><br \/>This book's language is absolutely wonderful.  Powerfully metaphorical and poetic, it made me question why this book is being marketed as a children's book.  Although the main character is a child, much of the action as well as the language is well beyond a child's comprehension; it occurred to me that perhaps the book could be profitably read by older students with the help of a teacher and class discussion of various parts.  It is a lovely and mysterious story, but in my opinion it is anything but a children's story.  It has been compared with Anne Frank, a book frequently taught in 8th or 9th grade, but it is far more challenging in tone, language, and subject matter.  When I was reading it, I was reminded of &#34;The Road,&#34; which was set in the aftermath of a war and likewise involved a journey, and is very much an adult book.  I am eager to hear what other reviewers have to say about this, and I would also love to hear from some young adult readers.  My guess is that they will not &#34;get&#34; the book without a little adult input.<br \/><br \/>I did like this book very much.  I recommend it for adult readers and very mature adolescents.","images":[],"asin":"0553513346","parent_asin":"0553513346","user_id":"AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ","timestamp":1449597523000,"helpful_vote":2,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":3,"title":"Extremely Poor Mystery, But With Darned Good Recipes","text":"BANANA CREAM PIE MURDER (A HANNAH SWENSON MYSTERY) doesn't work very well as a standalone, unless you're mainly interested in the many scrumptious dessert, cookie, quick-dinner, and snack recipes.  It's puzzling that newlywed Hannah doesn't know much about her husband Ross' likes or dislikes; and that she's apparently seeking a subordinate wife's role in their marriage.  Hannah's confusion about what's expected of her in her new daily routine weakens her previously established character as a strong, independent, happy-though-single businesswoman.<br \/><br \/>As a reader, I couldn't help wondering whether author Joanne Fluke is already regretting having married Hannah off?  (This happened in the previous novel, the 19th novel of the series, [[ASIN:1617732184 The Wedding Cake Murder]].  I probably should have read it before this one, though the novels are usually okay as standalones.)<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Hannah's mother Delores hears a scream from the luxury condo below hers, the condo owned by her close friend Tori.  When Delores investigates, she discovers that the former actress has been murdered.  Delores calls in detective Mike (oddly keeping back Tori's appointment book, an obviously important piece of evidence, to show to Hannah, who is due back from her honeymoon).<br \/><br \/>Hannah takes over the amateurs' murder investigation, using overheard grocery store conversations, as well as tips from local gossipy waitresses, and some breaking and entering, to move the investigation forward.  Hannah gets help from Delores, Doc, Michelle, Norman, and other friends and relatives.  Food is featured in almost every chapter as the family shares meals; or as Hannah bribes sources with Cookie Jar cookies; or as Mike shows up at the Cookie Jar for coffee and goodies, and to warn Hannah to stay clear of his murder investigation.  As Hannah's investigation advances, Ross becomes somewhat distant, and Hannah begins to doubt his love for her.<br \/><br \/>As a mystery, this is an extremely poor effort, but the recipes are darned good.  (You do need to enjoy reading about food to be able to enjoy this cozy mystery.)  Hannah's existing fans will certainly want to read this book to find out about the honeymoon, and to keep up with the ongoing  events in Hannah's somewhat weird extended family.  However, I hope that the next series book will be a much better mystery.","images":[],"asin":"1617732206","parent_asin":"1617732206","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1485827993000,"helpful_vote":14,"verified_purchase":false}

{"rating":4,"title":"One of the best reads on The Beatles' Apple Corps experiment","text":"I always loved this book by Apple's in-house hippie, Richard Di Lello.  I had it years ago, decades really, as a standard-size paperback and was happy to be able to pick up this most recent edition.  Bigger and better, yes. Makes for perfect reading after watching The Beatles Get Back revisionist rock-doc, which I just did very recently.  Di Lello's innocent hipster fingers rest easy on the pulse of the whole Apple Corps experiment \/ experience, and he spins the tale with humor, heart, and a sense of wonder.  That Apple ultimately failed to achieve its lofty, altruistic goals is undoubtedly heartbreaking.  But reading The Longest Cocktail Party, the ending was written on the wall from the very beginning; however, its all too brief but winding road was filled with wondrous moments of art and adventure.","images":[],"asin":"1470615177","parent_asin":"1470615177","user_id":"AE7BV6IMNPZ3F266H7PXMH3BZQNQ","timestamp":1646802062905,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}
{"rating":3,"title":"Pleasant \"Coming Home\" Novel About Unsolved Disappearance of 2-Year-Old Twins","text":"ARROWOOD is a pleasant mystery\/suspense novel that's hard to characterize.  The story revolves around a 17-year-old cold case, the disappearance of the 2-year-old twin sisters of the main character (Arden Arrowood).  It stars an old house (Arrowood, Arden's family home in Keokuk, Iowa), which the family abandoned, along with all its furnishings, shortly after the tragedy.  There's also a dollop of romance, as Arden seeks to rekindle an old relationship with her first love (Ben).<br \/><br \/>In the novel, Arden &#34;comes home&#34; to Keokuk after more than a decade's absence.  She has inherited Arrowood from her father, and moves into the house, which has been maintained by a creepy handyman (Dick Heaney).  Almost immediately, she is contacted by a true crime writer (Josh) who's investigating Iowa's famous unsolved crimes.  He has new, never-published evidence that disputes Arden's memory of the day the twins disappeared.  Reluctantly, Arden joins Josh's investigation, and she turns up additional new evidence by interviewing old neighbors, reading documents still stored in the house, and following up watery clues provided by the (apparently haunted) house itself.<br \/><br \/>The plot has a lot of twists, and I was enjoying this &#34;cozy suspense novel&#34; until everything kind of fell apart in a tacked-on &#34;action&#34; ending.  The Keokuk setting is interesting, although I couldn't tell whether the description of a slowly dying Mississippi river town was imaginary or was a reflection of the present-day state of the real Keokuk.  I did like Arden fairly well, and the other characters are not cardboard characters, although there isn't a whole lot of depth to them.  The actual writing is skilled, making this a slow-paced but highly readable book, great for summer vacation reading.  Because of the unsatisfying action ending, I rate ARROWOOD at 3 stars (&#34;It's okay&#34; on the official Amazon scale).","images":[],"asin":"0812996399","parent_asin":"0812996399","user_id":"AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q","timestamp":1463238714000,"helpful_vote":7,"verified_purchase":false}
{"rating":1,"title":"Loaded with errors!","text":"I don't think anyone proofread this before it was published.  I'm only up to puzzle number 25 and 17 of the past puzzles have errors in them.  At first there were only one or two errors in the puzzles but lately, it's entire rows of duplicate letters.  You spend more time correcting the puzzles and answer pages than you do in trying to work the puzzles.  Also, there is a lot of duplication in letter patterns.  I couldn't find a publisher's address anywhere in this volume or I'd complain to them so I think this author may have published it on his own.  If you don't mind correcting all the errors as you go along, then buy this book.  There are other Sudoku books out there that have no errors and are much cheaper so you're better off buying those.","images":[],"asin":"141167247X","parent_asin":"141167247X","user_id":"AHACWI47DVIEHMVFBJYFX4CQWLYQ","timestamp":1166202457000,"helpful_vote":1,"verified_purchase":true}
